  <p>A few interesting findings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When Novak won his first Grand Slam in early 2008, Federer already had won 12 Grand Slams titles!</li>
    <li>Federer did not win any major title between  2009 and 2012, and between 2012 and 2017. He essentially only won 4 titles between 2010 and 2018!</li>
    <li>With 1 title less than Nole and just one more season to play, not sure Rafa can catch up with his rival prior to retiring!</li>
  </ul>
